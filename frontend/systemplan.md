# Frontend System Plan

## 1. Overview

The frontend will be a web-based interface for interacting with the DuckLake system. It will provide a user-friendly way to browse, search, and visualize data stored in both DuckDB and MinIO.

## 2. Core Technologies

- **Framework:** React or Vue (to be decided)
- **Bundler:** Vite or Webpack
- **Styling:** A modern CSS framework like Tailwind CSS or Material-UI.
- **Data Fetching:** Axios or the built-in `fetch` API.

## 3. Key Features

- **Data Browser:** A unified view for browsing DuckLake tables and MinIO datasets.
- **Search:** Search functionality to find tables and datasets by name.
- **History and Lineage:** A view to display the history and lineage of data assets, powered by the OpenLineage integration in the backend.
- **WASM DuckDB View:** An embedded DuckDB instance (using DuckDB-WASM) to allow for in-browser querying of datasets loaded from MinIO.
- **File Upload/Download:** A user interface for uploading and downloading files to/from MinIO.

## 4. Implementation Details

- **Component-Based Architecture:** The frontend will be built using a component-based architecture, with clear separation of concerns.
- **State Management:** A state management library (like Redux or Pinia) will be used to manage application state.
- **API Interaction:** The frontend will communicate with the backend via the REST API.
- **Deployment:** The frontend will be a static application that can be served from a simple web server or a CDN. It can be containerized and deployed on Kubernetes.
